To resolve this issue, you need to configure the `delete_contents_on_destroy` property in your Terraform configuration.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. Open your `main.tf` file where the dataset is defined.\n2. Set the `delete_contents_on_destroy` property to `true` for the corresponding BigQuery dataset resource.\n\nHere is an example of how it should look:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"google_bigquery_dataset\" \"homework_dataset\" {\n  dataset_id = \"homework_dataset\"\n  // Add other necessary configurations here\n  \n  delete_contents_on_destroy = true\n}\n```\n\nAfter making this change, run `terraform apply` to ensure that the configuration is updated, and then try running `terraform destroy` again. This should allow you to successfully destroy the dataset without encountering the `resourceInUse` error.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the specific source [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-1/126_9f9a1b9e4f_terraform-teardown-of-bigquery-dataset.md).",
