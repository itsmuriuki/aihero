The `timedelta` object stores the duration in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. Each of these units must be manually converted into hours to express the total duration between the two timestamps using only hours.\n\nAnother method to achieve this is using the `datediff` SQL function. It requires the following parameters:\n\n- **Upper Date**: The closer date, e.g., `dropoff_datetime`.\n- **Lower Date**: The farther date, e.g., `pickup_datetime`.\n\nThe result is returned in days, so you can multiply the result by 24 to get the duration in hours.",

          "content": "To compute the difference in hours between two timestamps in PySpark, you can use either of the following methods:\n\n1. **Using `datetime.timedelta`:** \n   PySpark will convert the difference of two `TimestampType` values to a Python `datetime.timedelta` object. This object stores the duration in days, seconds, and microseconds. You will need to convert these units manually into hours to express the total duration between the two timestamps. \n\n   Here's a general idea of how you can do it:\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n   from pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\n   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"TimestampDiff\").getOrCreate()\n   \n   # Sample DataFrame\n   data = [(\"2023-01-01 12:00:00\", \"2023-01-01 14:30:00\")]\n   df = spark.createDataFrame(data, [\"start_time\", \"end_time\"])\n   \n   # Convert to TimestampType\n   df = df.withColumn(\"start_time\", col(\"start_time\").cast(\"timestamp\"))\n   df = df.withColumn(\"end_time\", col(\"end_time\").cast(\"timestamp\"))\n   \n   # Calculate difference and convert to hours\n   df = df.withColumn(\"hours_difference\", (col(\"end_time\").cast(\"long\") - col(\"start_time\").cast(\"long\")) / 3600)\n   df.show()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `datediff` function:**\n   You can use the `datediff` SQL function to find the difference between two timestamps, which gives the result in days. To convert days to hours, simply multiply the result by 24:\n\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n   from pyspark.sql.functions import datediff, col\n\n   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"TimestampDiff\").getOrCreate()\n   \n   # Sample DataFrame\n   data = [(\"2023-01-01 12:00:00\", \"2023-01-02 12:00:00\")]\n   df = spark.createDataFrame(data, [\"start_time\", \"end_time\"])\n   \n   # Calculate days difference and convert to hours\n   df = df.withColumn(\"days_difference\", datediff(col(\"end_time\"), col(\"start_time\")))\n   df = df.withColumn(\"hours_difference\", col(\"days_difference\") * 24)\n   df.show()\n   ```\n\nThese methods allow you to compute the difference in hours between two timestamps in PySpark.
