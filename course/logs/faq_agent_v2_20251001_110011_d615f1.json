Before injecting data into GCS, use `astype` and `Int64` (which is different from `int64` and accepts both missing values and integers) to cast the columns.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    ```\n\n2.

          "content": "Yes, it is possible to cluster data by a TIMESTAMP column in BigQuery. You can cluster directly on TIMESTAMP columns without needing to convert them to other types. Clustering in BigQuery organizes the data to optimize query performance, especially for queries that filter on specific time ranges such as using the `WHERE` clause with conditions like `BETWEEN`.\n\nFor instance, if you have a column `tpep_pickup_datetime`, you can simply use it in the CLUSTER BY clause. This approach is particularly useful for queries that need to access specific ranges of data efficiently.\n\nCombining clustering with partitioning can further enhance performance for time-based queries. You might partition your data by a `DATE` column (like `DATE(event_time)`) and cluster it by a `TIMESTAMP` column (like `tpep_pickup_datetime`). This setup allows you to leverage both partitioning's capabilities to prune down data scans and clustering's ability to organize data within partitions for faster access.\n\nFor references, see:\n1.
