This method avoids hardcoding secrets in your code and works seamlessly with most environments.\n\n### Configuration Files (Recommended for Local Use)\n\n- Use `.dlt/secrets.toml` for sensitive credentials and `.dlt/config.toml` for non-sensitive configurations.\n- Example for Google Cloud in `secrets.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[google_cloud]\nservice_account_key = \"YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY\"\n```\n\n- Place these files in the `.dlt` folder of your project.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control (add it to `.gitignore`).\n- Credentials can also be loaded via vaults, AWS Parameter Store, or custom setups.\n\nFor additional methods and detailed information, refer to the [official dlt documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/)",
