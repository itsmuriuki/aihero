Replace `spark://localhost:7077` with the appropriate master URL if it\u2019s different:\n   ```bash\n   bin\\spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://localhost:7077 --host localhost\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Cluster Configuration**: You can check the Spark UI at `http://localhost:8080` to ensure that both the master and worker are running correctly.\n\n5. **Set Up Spark Session**: In a Jupyter notebook, set up the Spark session with the following code:\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n   spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n       .master(\"spark://localhost:7077\") \\\n       .appName('test') \\\n       .getOrCreate()\n   ```\n\nThese steps will allow you to run a Spark cluster in standalone mode on your local machine.
