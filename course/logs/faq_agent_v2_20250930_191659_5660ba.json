This method avoids hardcoding secrets in your code and works seamlessly with most environments.\n\n### Configuration Files (Recommended for Local Use)\n\n- Use `.dlt/secrets.toml` for sensitive credentials and `.dlt/config.toml` for non-sensitive configurations.\n- Example for Google Cloud in `secrets.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[google_cloud]\nservice_account_key = \"YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY\"\n```\n\n- Place these files in the `.dlt` folder of your project.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control (add it to `.gitignore`).\n- Credentials can also be loaded via vaults, AWS Parameter Store, or custom setups.\n\nFor additional methods and detailed information, refer to the [official dlt documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/)",

          "content": "When managing sensitive credentials while pushing code to git, it is important to follow best practices to ensure that these credentials are never exposed publicly. Here are some recommended methods:\n\n1. **Environment Variables**: This is the easiest way to manage credentials. Set sensitive information as environment variables in your development environment. For example, you can configure Google Cloud credentials by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable. This method avoids hardcoding secrets into your code.\n\n2. **Configuration Files**: You can use a file such as `.dlt/secrets.toml` for sensitive credentials, which should not be committed to your version control. Instead, add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked. An example configuration might look like:\n   ```toml\n   [google_cloud]\n   service_account_key = \"YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY\"\n   ```\n\n3. **.gitignore**: Always use a `.gitignore` file to exclude files that contain sensitive information (e.g., `.env`, `secret.json`). This prevents accidental commits of sensitive data to your repository.\n\n4. **Use .env files with dotenv**: You can also create a `.env` file to manage environment variables in your project. Using the `python-dotenv` package, you can load these variables into your code, ensuring credentials are not hardcoded into your scripts. For example:\n   ```python\n   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n   import os\n\n   load_dotenv()\n   credentials_path = os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\") \n   BUCKET = os.environ.get(\"GCP_GCS_BUCKET\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Never store passwords or keys directly in the repo**: Even in private repositories, it is crucial to avoid storing sensitive credentials in your codebase.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the following sources: \n\n- [How to set up credentials to run dlt in my environment](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/workshop-1-dlthub/009_d2add610e3_how-do-i-set-up-credentials-to-run-dlt-in-my-envir.md)\n- [How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/general/042_dc06a38bc6_how-do-i-use-git-github-for-this-course.md)\n- [How to set environment variable easily for any credentials](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq-main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/074_fb43c209d9_how-to-set-environment-variable-easily-for-any-cre.md)",
