Familiarize yourself with documentation as a crucial skill for problem-solving.\n- Use shortcuts like `[ctrl+f]` to search within documents and browsers.\n- Analyze the error message for descriptions, instructions, and possible solutions.\n- Restart your application, server, or computer as needed.\n  \n**Search for Solutions:**\n\n- Use search engines like Google, ChatGPT, or Bing AI to research the issue. It is rare to encounter a unique problem.\n- Form your search queries using: `<technology> <problem statement>`. E.g., `pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.`\n- Consult the technology\u2019s official documentation for guidance.\n\n**Uninstallation and Reinstallation:**\n\n- Uninstall and then reinstall the application if needed, including a system restart.\n- Note that reinstalling without prior uninstallation might not resolve the issue.\n\n**Seeking Help:**\n\n- Post questions on platforms like StackOverflow. Ensure your question adheres to guidelines: [how-to-ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n- Consider asking experts or colleagues in the future.\n\n**Community Resources:**\n\n- Check Slack channels for pinned messages and use its search function.\n- Refer to this FAQ using search `[ctrl+f]` or utilize the `@ZoomcampQABot` for assistance.\n\n**When Asking for Help:**\n\n- Provide detailed information: coding environment, OS, commands, videos followed, etc.\n- Share errors received, with specifics, including line numbers and actions taken.\n- Avoid screenshots; paste code or errors directly. Use ``` for code formatting.\n- Maintain thread consistency; respond in the same thread instead of creating multiple ones.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\n- If the issue recurs, create a new post detailing changes in the environment.\n- Communicate additional troubleshooting steps in the same thread.\n- Occasionally take a break to gain a fresh perspective on the problem.\n\n**Documentation Contribution:**\n\n- If your problem solution is not listed, consider adding it to the FAQ to assist others.",

This is because pandas by default will parse integer columns with missing values as float type.\n\nSolution:\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to specify or cast the data type as `Int64` during the data transformation stage.\n\nIf specifying all the integer columns is inconvenient, you can use `convert_dtypes` to infer the data type automatically.\n\n- Make pandas infer the correct data type (as pandas parse int with missing as float):\n\n```python\n# Fill missing values with a placeholder\n df.fillna(-999999, inplace=True)\n\n# Infer data types\n df = df.convert_dtypes()\n\n# Replace placeholder with None\n df = df.replace(-999999, None)\n```",

Make sure to restart your computer before reinstalling.\n\n5. **Seeking Community Help**:\n   - Post detailed questions on platforms like StackOverflow, ensuring that you adhere to their asking guidelines.\n   - Look for help in community channels, such as Slack, where resources and FAQs can be found.\n\n6. **Detailing Your Question**:\n   - When asking for help, provide comprehensive details such as your coding environment, operating system, exact commands run, and any error messages received (avoiding screenshots in favor of text).\n\n7. **Re-evaluation and Persistence**:\n   - If the issue recurs, document changes in your environment and additional troubleshooting steps in the same forum thread.\n   - Sometimes stepping away from the problem can provide a fresh perspective.\n\n8. **Contributing to Documentation**:\n   - If you find a solution that is not documented, consider contributing it to FAQs or community resources to assist others facing similar issues.\n\nThese strategies can serve as a comprehensive approach for dealing with technical problems effectively during the course.
