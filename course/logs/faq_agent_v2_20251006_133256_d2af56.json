However, running the whole script in the Jupyter notebook for a second time from top to bottom will result in missing the first chunk of 100,000 records. This occurs because a call to the iterator appears before the while loop, leading to the second chunk being ingested first.\n\n### Solution:\n\n- Remove the cell `df=next(df_iter)` located higher up in the notebook than the while loop.\n- Ensure the first `w(df_iter)` call is within the while loop.\n\n\ud83d\udcd4 **Note:** The notebook is used to test the code and is not intended to be run top to bottom.

You can upgrade it with the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install nbconvert --upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Basic Conversion Command**: When converting your notebook, use the following command, replacing `your_notebook.ipynb` with your actual notebook name:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbconvert --to script your_notebook.ipynb\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative Conversion Using Jupytext**: If you continue to have errors with `nbconvert`, consider using Jupytext, which is another tool for converting Jupyter notebooks. Here\u2019s how to do it:\n   - Install Jupytext:\n     ```bash\n     pip install jupytext\n     ```\n   - Convert your notebook:\n     ```bash\n     jupytext --to py your_notebook.ipynb\n     ```\n\nThese steps should help you resolve issues with converting your Jupyter notebook.
